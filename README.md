# JaJai
JaJai is my Bachelor’s thesis project in Computer Engineering at the University of Bologna (UNIBO).  It is a local conversational AI system that allows users to query PDF documents using natural language. The application runs entirely on the user’s machine, ensuring full data privacy without relying on external servers.
